# üí° Two-Player LED Memory Game (ATmega64 Assembly)

A classic **Two-Player Memory Game** implemented on the **ATmega64** microcontroller using Assembly language. The system challenges two users to replicate a displayed LED pattern within a limited time, utilizing timers and interrupts for precise control.

## üåü Project Goal

The primary objective was to design and implement a digital logic system for a two-player memory game.
1.  **Player 1** enters a specific **LED sequence/pattern** using an input method.
2.  **Player 2** must observe and **replicate the exact sequence** within a **limited timeframe**.
3.  The system manages the display of the pattern and the time constraint using **timers** and **interrupts**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup (Simulation)

Since the project is implemented on a specific microcontroller in Assembly, the standard method for viewing the results is via simulation.

1.  **Install Proteus:** Ensure you have the Proteus simulation software (ISIS/ARES) installed.
2.  **Download Files:** Clone this repository and locate the following files:
    * **Assembly Source Code:** `[project_name].asm` (The core logic)
    * **Hex File:** `[project_name].hex` (The compiled output)
    * **Proteus Schematic:** `[project_name].pdsprj` (The circuit design file)
3.  **Load Simulation:**
    * Open the `.pdsprj` file in **Proteus**.
    * **Double-click** the ATmega64 component in the schematic.
    * Browse and load the compiled **`.hex`** file into the "Program File" field.
4.  **Run:** Click the **Play/Run** button in Proteus to start the simulation and begin the game.
